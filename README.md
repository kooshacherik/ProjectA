This is a summery of my pair trade strategy . In pair trade , we pick two cointegrated instruments and open our positions  base on ratio price reversion toward a constant mean value .Lets assume that we have picked pair A and pair B . Subsequently , we consider A/B for determining our entry signal and fiing a stopl loss . ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76734519/228363389-7ce8fe8e-8060-4564-9b17-d32c70402b00.png)
